    Mechanical Engineering endows students with the basic understanding and knowledge of how heavy
tools and machinery work. A student pursuing a mechanical engineering programme will acquire knowledge 
about designing of automobiles, electric motors, aircraft and other heavy vehicles.Mechanical engineers 
design everything from new batteries, athletic equipment to medical devices and from personal computers, 
air conditioners, automobile engines to electric power plants. These engineers also design machines 
that produce these innovations.The scope of mechanical engineering in India and abroad is huge for
every aspect of our lives are touched by mechanical engineering in one way of the other. Spanning 
multiple industries, the career opportunities for students pursuing the programme is huge.

    Mechanical Engineering covers aspects like design and testing among others. The job demands 
supervision and planning of live projects related to thermal power plants, nuclear stations, 
generation of electricity, etc.There are employment opportunities for diploma holders who have
practical knowledge of working on fields like testing of machinery etc.The emerging fields in this
area include renewable energy, automobiles, quality control, Industrial Automation, Mechanobiology. 
These are going to increase manpower in the work profile of mechanical engineering and would offer
employment opportunities.
