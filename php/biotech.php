        Biotechnology is one of the most progressive and beneficial scientific 
    advances of the last quarter century. An interdisciplinary field that 
    includes mathematics, physics, chemistry,engineering and others, it 
    combines various- technologies to either create a new product or modify
    an existing one to suit our needs.

        Its widespread application across multiple industries like food, 
    pharmaceutical, chemical,bio-products, textiles, medicine, nutrition,
    environmental conservation and animal sciences makes a career in 
    biotechnology one of the fastest growing fields with ample 
    opportunities for qualified professionals.
                
       Biotechnology combines the theoretical (genetics, molecular 
    biology, biochemistry, embryology and cell biology), and the 
    practical (chemical engineering, information technology and robotics) 
    scientific aptitude, a keen interest in the biological sciences,
    problem solving skills.An analytical mind is essential for 
    successful career in biotechnology.

            <button class="button b1"> Eligibility and Admission</button><br>
            <pre>
        10 + 2 science stream graduates can opt for a B.Tech 
    (Biotechnology) or an integrated M. Tech (Biotechnology); 
    science stream graduates from any field (engineering, medicine etc.) 
    can opt for a M. Tech (Biotechnology).IIT Delhi and Kharagpur 
    offer admission into a five year integrated M.Tech through 
    a Joint Entrance Examination.The Jawaharlal Nehru University,
    New Delhi conducts an all-India entrance examination for 
    their Msc Biotechnology program.

    A bio-technologist may find jobs in various quarters.
    Biotechnology jobs in India can be found in the following fields:

                Drug and pharmaceutical research
                Public funded laboratories
                Chemicals
                Environment control
                Waste management
                Energy
                Food processing
                Bio-processing industries
    
    While government institutes and organizations, such as 
    Department of Biotechnology (DBT),several agriculture,
    dairy and horticulture institutes may offer job opportunities
    to Biotechnology professionals, one can expect the best
    salary in private sector.
            
     Drug companies in biotechnology like Dabur, Ranbaxy,
    Hindustan Lever and Dr Reddy's Labs that have their 
    R & D units offer Biotechnology professionals with
    handsome pay-packages. There are also ample opportunities
    available to bio-technologists in the food processing 
    industry, chemical industry and the textile industry.
                
   Some industries employ bio-technologists in their 
   marketing divisions to develop business in sectors
    where their products would be required.The major 
    companies, hiring bio-technologists, include 
    Hindustan Lever, Thapar Group, Indo American 
    Hybrid Seeds, Bincon India Ltd., IDPL and 
    Hindustan Antibiotics.

            <pre>
    The Government of India provides large-scale employment
    to most bio-technologists in its research laboratories.
    Those employed as researchers in government sector can 
    have a starting salary of Rs. 9000 per month along 
    with government perks/allowances.
    Private sector pharmaceutical companies generally offer
    salary between Rs. 12,000- Rs. 20,000 per month 
    to an entry-level postgraduate. A skilled and 
    experienced bio-technologist can get salaries far 
    beyond his expectations.
