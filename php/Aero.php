    Aeronautical Engineering is the science associated with the study, design, and production of
flight-capable machinery or aircraft operating techniques. It is the study of the design and operations
of an aircraft that involves practical and theoretical understanding of materials, assembling parts, 
testing, and maintenance of aircraft. An Aeronautical Engineer's primary job is to design aircraft 
and thrust systems, but there can be more responsibilities added to the profile with time. 
An Aeronautical Engineer may get opportunities in the Aviation industry, defence, and civil aviation 
department. The job may bring lucrative packages, but it also might be a very responsible 
and demanding job. It is an important branch of engineering that has helped mankind to 
master the world above the skies.

  Aerospace Engineering is a board branch of research that deals with the study of aircraft
and spacecraft and their production. In India and a lot of other countries, it is still a 
growing market. Yet India offers good potential in the field of aerospace engineering, 
as an booming sector  One can opt to be a scientist or technician. Scientists usually 
work in any of the three places - manufacturing research and development, private and 
government labs and educational research. Even Engineers can select from different roles 
such as manufacturing, flight analysis, materials and processes, construction, etc. 
A person also has the option of joining an organization of Indian space research or NASA. 
In addition to NASA and ISRO, various public and private airlines, India's Helicopter Corporation,
 Aircraft companies, military and defence departments, aeronautical companies, space equipment,
  and aircraft design organizations hire aviation engineers.

  Aeronautical electronics engineers specialize in instrument maintenance, electrical and 
electronic equipment, navigation, radar communications, and radio communication. At airports, 
engineers perform routine maintenance on the ground during an aircraft overhaul. They respond to 
reports from aircrew of any difficulties experienced during flights, and carry out repairs and 
corrections and also perform aircraft maintenance and overhaul in hangers and workshops when an 
aircraft is due for regular inspection and checks.

   The average salary of an Aeronautical Engineer is Rs 6 lakh or more. With experience, the earning 
grows manifold. It can go as high as Rs 45- 49 Lakh per annum.Engineers in governmental organizations,
such as HAL, NAL, are paid official rates, while private-sector engineers are paid according to the 
scales determined by the company management.
