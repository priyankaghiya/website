<pre>If you try to do too much studying at one time, 
you will tire and your studying will not be very effective.
Space the work you have to do over shorter periods of time. 
Taking short breaks will restore your mental energy.

<pre>Study time is any time you are doing something related to schoolwork.
 It can be completing assigned reading, working on a paper or project,
 or studying for a test.
 Schedule specific times throughout the week for your study time.

<pre>Studying at the same times each day establishes a 
routine that becomes a regular part of your life, 
just like sleeping and eating.
When a scheduled study time comes up during the day,
you will be mentally prepared to begin studying.
</pre>
</td>
<td><img src="../images/sh4.png" class="images">
<pre>Goals will help you stay focused and monitor 
your progress. Simply sitting down to study has little value.
You must be very clear about what you want to accomplish 
during your study times.

<pre>You may delay starting your studying because you 
don't like an assignment or think it is too hard.
A delay in studying is called "procrastination."
If you procrastinate for any reason, you will find 
it difficult to get everything done when you need to.
You may rush to make up the time you wasted getting started,
resulting in careless work and errors.
</pre>

<td><img src="../images/sh6.jpg" class="images">
<pre>Your most difficult assignment will require the
most effort. Start with your most difficult assignment
since this is when you have the most mental energy.

<pre>Reviewing your notes can help you make sure you are 
doing an assignment correctly. Also, your notes may 
include information that will help you complete an assignment.

<pre>Two study problems can occur if your friends call
you during your study times. First, your work is interrupted.
It is not that easy to get back to what you were doing.
Second, your friends may talk about things that will distract
you from what you need to do.
Here's a simple idea - turn off your cell phone during your study times.

<pre>Yes, weekends should be fun time. 
But there is also time to do some review. 
This will help you be ready to go on Monday 
morning when another school week begins.
