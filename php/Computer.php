 B.Tech. Computer Engineering is a course which trains professionals with working knowledge
 of both computer hardware and software. B.Tech. Computer Engineering graduate is skilled in
 developing computers  and computer-based systems.This course is a perfect blend of hardware
 and software knowledge and provides an edge over those with only knowledge of software or
 hardware. B.Tech. Computer Engineering is perfect for such students who wish to learn about
 aspects of programming in computer languages and also physical components of a computer and 
 its workings.The curriculum for B.Tech. Computer Engineering consists of Core papers and 
 electives. Core papers are mainly taught in the first year and deal with fundamental knowledge
 of engineering. Elective papers aim to impart special skills which are specifically 
 related to the branch of computer engineering. Generally, students have to choose elective subjects. 

 Students are also required to undergo an industrial training of minimum 2 weeks during the 
 summer break between 4th and 5th semester. The training includes a particular set of marking
 criteria which are accordingly graded to students.The duration of B.Tech. Computer Engineering 
 course is of eight semesters spanning 4 years and includes general engineering education as 
 well as core Computer Science education. Apart from the course, the curriculum includes a 
 seminar (in the third year) and a final year dissertation. The course structure provides
 an optimal mix of compulsory and elective courses.
