    In first half of the course, the students go through the basic engineering concept, physics,
mathematics and chemistry. In the second half of the course, the students go through the core study of 
communication such as design, digital electronics, fundamental of Electronics engineering, signal & circuit,
electronic circuits, VLSI, power electronics, computer architecture, and control systems.
  After completion of UG degree the students are designated as the Bachelor of Engineering or Bachelor of
  Technology, depending on the University.A bachelor degree usually covers the mathematics, physics, 
  and computer science.

  The basic eligibility for admission to a B.Tech. EC Engineering program is a pass in Higher Secondary 
or 10+2 examination in science stream. Certain institutes require students to have studied EC in
10+2. Eligibility for the program also depends upon the performance in entrance tests such as JEE Main, 
JEE Advanced, SET, CUSAT,Gujcet etc.
