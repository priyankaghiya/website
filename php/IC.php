        Instrumentation and Control Engineering is a specialized domain under the ambit of electrical 
and electronics engineering. It takes it’s aspects from the domain of electrical engineering as well 
electronics to focus on the core objective of design and configuration of automated systems.

        Today automated instruments have used in a wide variety of applications at industry level which
includes packaging, fitting, flaw detection, standardization etc. To keep these systems strong and running 
trained professionals are required. With the advent of automation and embedded system, the need for such 
professionals is only going to increase in the future.B.E. Instrumentation and Control Engineering course
aim at delivering those qualified professionals to the industry by equipping the UG students with technical 
skills and knowledge in the domain.

 B.Tech. Computer Engineering is a course which trains professionals with working knowledge of both computer
 hardware and software. B.Tech. Computer Engineering graduate is skilled in developing computers 
 and computer-based systems.This course is a perfect blend of hardware and software knowledge and
 provides an edge over those with only knowledge of software or hardware. B.Tech. Computer Engineering
 is perfect for such students who wish to learn about aspects of programming in computer languages and
 also physical components of a computer and its workings.The curriculum for B.Tech. Computer Engineering
 consists of Core papers and electives. Core papers are mainly taught in the first year and deal with 
 fundamental knowledge of engineering. Elective papers aim to impart special skills which are specifically 
 related to the branch of computer engineering. Generally, students have to choose elective subjects. 

 Students are also required to undergo an industrial training of minimum 2 weeks during the summer 
 break between 4th and 5th semester. The training includes a particular set of marking criteria which 
 are accordingly graded to students.The duration of B.Tech. Computer Engineering course is of eight 
 semesters spanning 4 years and includes general engineering education as well as core Computer 
 Science education. Apart from the course, the curriculum includes a seminar (in the third year) and 
 a final year dissertation. The course structure provides an optimal mix of compulsory and elective courses.

        <pre>
    Candidate must have passed the 10+2 or equivalent examination from a recognized state or central 
board with at least 65% (relaxable for reserved category candidates) of the marks with Physics,
Chemistry, Mathematics, and English as the major subjects of study.
    He/She shall not be having any Supplementary or Compartment in any of the subject/Subjects 
at 10+2 or equivalent level that is yet to be cleared at the time of taking admissions.Apart from 
the above-mentioned eligibility criteria’s various colleges and institutes may have their own 
additional criteria’s which the students would have to satisfy in order to take admission.
In case of reserved category students, they would have to present their reservation certificates
issued by the competent authorities in order to avail the benefits applicable to them.Most of the
Institute give admissions through Common Entrance Test (CET) (like JEE Main, UPSEE, WBJEE, OJEE etc).
To get admissions in these institutes candidates would have to qualify the respective entrance exam 
by securing minimum qualifying marks.The eligibility criteria’s mentioned above are common to most
of the universities and colleges across the country that are offering this course to the students.

    Admissions to BE Instrumentation and Control Engineering involves a common entrance test based 
admission process (as seen across various Universities and colleges in the country) as well as a 
merit-based selection process (in select few institutes/colleges).Students who have passed their
10+2 or equivalent level examinations with a minimum of 65% marks (relaxable for reserved category 
students) can make application in colleges offering the course.Majority of the Universities/Colleges
conduct a common entrance test for admission into B.E courses (like BITSAT) or take admissions through
commonly held entrance exam like JEE Main, OJEE,WBJEE etc. Hence students would have to make an 
application for such exams.Students have to qualify these exams (for which they should be
eligible to appear) in order to get admission in the course.
