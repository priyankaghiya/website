     Biotechnology is a part of Applied Biology,
     which simply stated, is the combination of
     biology with technology so as to alter 
     cells for manipulation. The course 
     familiarizes candidates with the 
    usage of living organisms and bio
    processes in the field of medicine,
    technology, engineering, and 
    other bio products.

    Typically, the course aims to impart to 
    eligible candidates, advanced lessons in 
    biological process meant for industrial
    and other purposes, especially the genetic 
    manipulation of microorganisms for the
    production of antibiotics, hormones, etc.
    which are used in production of medicines 
    and other such products.
